                    <p>Various sources claim they have first found the wild species known as ABHINAY but after extensive research and talking to some of the
                        natives of the village it was said to be found I conclude that ABHINAY originated from a small colony of black apes.</p>
                        <p>Only ABHINAY evolved because of its laziness. It is said that its laziness shocked the researchers as it was lazier than a sloth. It took 15 million years to evolve the ABHINAY but it seems it only got lazier.</p>
                            <p>I traced back its footprint to a place called 1.8K where it dwelled with a nice human
                                being who took care of it regardless of its stupidity. But recent discoveries and suggested that this creature migrated to a colder suburban area where food can be found very easily and it is delicious too. After following this lead I travelled through various challenges to get to that place.</p>
                    <p>After a challenging journey I finally reached its habitat and it is called 'Azad Hall of Residence'. I stuck around for a while to observe this creature's behaviour and found new characteristics with other rare mammals such as someone called 'Daddy', 'Rolex', and few known creatures I will be talking about later</p>

                    <p>This creature recently emerged from 1000 years of slumber. When asked about its existence many natives of its village denied it. I could see fear in their eyes but then I asked the village elder and he said that this creature was a sweet, warm and harmless being that once lost its way and found itself in his village. For a very long it dwelled there and helped the villagers.</p>
                    <p>Its strength was used to carry huge logs and hauling boulders. It helped in building the so called Village Hall where several festivals are held.</p>
                    <p>Nobody knows where exactly it originated from but they think it was near an Apple Store in Vijaywada. The village Elder told me that it was treated like a slave but it thought it was helping and one day the villagers started ordering it which it didn't like. So, it howled at them which made them scared and in sheer stupidity they threw rocks at it which angered it more. It leaped onto some villagers and tore them apart scaring the shit out of other villagers.</p>
                    <p>Later realising what it has done it couldn't forgive itself so it left the village and went towards the NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TRAGEDY in WARANGAL. There it lived with people who loved it and finally found peace.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Originated from the same era of VAMSI but a bit later. People have confirmed its spotting in various HARRY STYLES concerts across the world. Some even go on record to tell that they saw her screaming for ARIANA GRANDE in her concerts. At first I was very sceptical about researching this creature but then I have to warn people about thses creatures.</p>
                        <p>In some ancient texts a mention of this creature was made but with another name MRID from which the modern name MRIDULA evolved. MRID meant beauty without a brain. In the Indus Valley Civilisation people used to lock their houses after dusk so that they wouldn't had to listen to its stupid ideas.</p>
                        <p>I journeyed far across the continent to meet one who made contact with this dumb creature. He seemed frustrated but agreed to talk about it. When asked about its habitat he said everywhere. He meant MRID wanders everywhere in search of fresh brilliant minds to hunt and suck their intelligence only to destroy it later.</p>
                        <p>I also asked him where MRID first came from and he said it was first seen at Paris-Bordeaux-Paris race of June 1895. He also told me that this creature might look scary but has many weaknesses. This creature has all the deficiencies in the world and blood level lower than a human child. You could probably beat this creature in a fight but later regret beating it as it would immediately start crying.</p>
                        <p>Though few manuscripts depicts its extreme intelligence in managing and communication. I have found stone tablets where it was recorded that this creature had excellent mind for matters realting commerce.</p>
                        <p>If you ever encounter a MRIDULA slowly turn back and leave its habitat otherwise you will be drained of whatever intelligence you got left.</p>

                        <p>The most mysterious creature in this collection of entries and by far the most intelligent one. I have worked with big brains people and all were amazed by its intellect. I asked few people who claim to have seen this creature and when asked they described it as a cuckoo bird but with wings wider than a fighter jet. Some even say it looked like a dragon. This description of the creature made it a legend. I have strong sources who say the first appearance it ever made was in Shanghai, China.</p>
                        <p>Near the yellow river there were villages which worshiped this dragon but no one for sure knew the true nature of this beast. Some considered its sight as an omen whereas others celebrated its coming with fireworks and sky lanterns. Almost half of the china was behind it; they wanted to kill it for its magical powers whereas the other half wanted to protect it at any cost because they thought it brought rain and good harvest.\n\nThis difference in opinion led to the Civil War in China led by Kang Loo Chi against the Emperor Darth Vader. Many people died during the war but at the end Kang Loo Chi won and declared the creature holy and named it SILVER SRAG.</p>
                        <p>A new holiday was declared to celebrate the win over the Emperor. That was how Chinese New Year began. Recent discoveries has confirmed the existence of this creature but any further research has been terminated indefinitely due to current issues of COVID-19.</p>
                        <p>I hope we will get to know about this creature and may its magical powers help humanity reach another level(preferably n = 4).</p>

                        <p>Though mostly it has been seen flying alone there are some accords where it was seen with another creature mentioned before, MRIDULA and VEDIKA. We already know about one but why does it carry MRIDULA and fly around the continent? That nobody knows but there seems a mutual attraction between them.</p>
                        <p>Also there were many instances where it was caught involving romantically with MRIDULA. People who are interested in it include half population of the well known Sanctuary NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TRAGEDY in WARANGAL.</p>

                        <p>This is the most dangerous creature humanity has ever seen. Don't be fooled by its innocent face. It can tear you apart in few seconds without breaking a sweat.</p>
                        <p>I have carefully researched about it found some horrible secrets. This creature of the night once lived a life full of happiness and bright colours but then one day came humans and started killing its friends. Being only one of a kind this creature thought of using its wits against the them and save its forest but later it found out that humans were stronger than it estimated them to be and crueler.</p>
                        <p>DEB stood there paralyzed by one of the darts blown at him by a human. Every friend it knew was slowly killed in front of its eyes and there was nothing it could do. That broke its spirit and that moment it took a vow, a vow that at any cost it would bring justice to unjust and from there began the famous journey of the urban legen, BATMAN.</p>
                        <p>Many believe BATMAN was just a myth but later when more and more frequent appearances it made the more convincing it got.</p>
                        <p>I spoke with a man who has been on tail of this creature and he said that this creature is more vicious, stronger, crueler and merciless than any other creature known to him. At night when there is a crime going comes this creature with its wings spreading across its enemies face like a blanket of suffering and delivering what it couldn't have several thousand of years ago.</p>
